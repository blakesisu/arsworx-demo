We also identify and help to implement systemic policy changes that can better support effective practices.\n\nCareer Advancement Academies (CAAs): Launched in 2007, the Career Advancement Academies are designed to enable underserved Californians ��� typically first in their families to attend college, low-income, or from communities of color ��� to enroll in higher education and adjust to emerging and evolving workforce and industry needs. Specifically, CAAs aim to increase the supply of middle skill workers by targeting under-prepared young adults (ages 18-30) whose low basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics shut them out of post-secondary education and high-wage jobs. CAAs support students through a holistic set of interventions to build the foundational skills needed to complete post-secondary education and enter careers.\n\nCalifornia Community College Linked Learning Initiative (CCCLLI): The goal of the CCC Linked Learning Initiative is to extend the promise of Linked Learning into post-secondary education. CCCLLI aims to strengthen the connec�_tions between Linked Learning High Schools and their local community colleges. Using the CA Linked Learning District Initiative as a launching point, involved partners are working to align and extend pathways into the community colleges and other post-secondary institutions.",

YPG offers unlimited free music production software for schools and students in its programs. Pushing traditional music education into the 21st century, YPG in-school workshops are all about writing music in the styles that students actually listen to. Although they function differently depending on the age groups, each workshop results in pieces of music that students and families can listen to online. Lawrence Grey and the YPG instructors create a fun environment where young people are encouraged to collaborate, experiment, and discover the joy of writing music. \n\n\nAfter school:\nWe offer after-school workshops for the young producers who are serious about their production. Those who participate in the after-school workshops are often already involved with YPG through in-school workshops or private lessons. Those who are new to YPG typically are already producing on their own. If not, they know that production will be something they will take seriously. With two different levels, young people can be at any skill level in the after-school workshops as long as they are passionate about electronic music. DJs, producers, managers, and other people working in the music industry come in and share their knowledge and passion with the group. Previous guests artists include Daedelus, Groundislava, John Tejada, DJ House Shoes, Benedek, and many others.\n\nPrivate Lessons:\nPrivate lessons give YPG members an opportunity to dig deep into the topics they find most interesting and refine their work one-on-one with a YPG instructor. The member's interests guide the instruction. If a member would like to have a lesson with Lawrence Grey, they will need to travel to his studio in Koreatown. The other YPG instructors can travel to a member�۪s house. Lessons are one or two hours long. Group lessons are also available.",
