Creativity + Leadership = Civic Engagement

We believe creative problem-solving is one of the core skills necessary to bring about a world that is more equitable and just. To that end, weâ€™re producing a national series of Youth Creativity Summits utilizing the lens of creativity as a tool for problem-solving and future planning. These forums will provide a space for young people to explore the role creativity can play as they forge their futures and accomplish their goals, no matter where their interests lie. Driven by the belief that â€œlearning by doingâ€ù is learning at its most powerful, the Creativity Summit series is dedicated to working with young people to create engaged, empowered and informed thinkers and leaders.

The Summits will be daylong events held in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Washington DC. in partnership with national organizations such as Youth Opportunity United and Faber Castell, and local partners including Los Angeles Unified School District, Hyde Park Arts Center, the Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center Education. The summits will consist of multiple elements, from immersive workshops to engaging panels, all with the goal of connecting participants to their own creativity, no matter how it manifests. Young people will engage in a series of creative problem-solving challenges, hear from creative professionals about their paths and goals, and most importantly, tell their own stories.",14;15;16;17;18;19-24;Ages 14-22,No restrictions/all populations served,,"City of Los Angeles;Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and DC",no contact name on website,https://www.youthcreativitysummit.org,No2018/07/19 12:24:07 PM MDT,Music Center,non-profit,,Arts Integration Partnerships,fine and performing arts school;visual and performing arts providers,"INSTRUCTION: increase students' interest, abilities and skills in the creative arts;EXPOSURE: introduce students to career opportunities in the creative industries;RE-ENGAGEMENT: reconnect young people to their education and their future through the creative arts","The Music Center seeks to maximize the impact, value, and sustainability of our work.

Available for students K-12, YPG in-school workshops foster creativity and self-esteem while building technical understanding of music production and recording. YPG offers unlimited free music production software for schools and students in its programs. Pushing traditional music education into the 21st century, YPG in-school workshops are all about writing music in the styles that students actually listen to. Although they function differently depending on the age groups, each workshop results in pieces of music that students and families can listen to online. Lawrence Grey and the YPG instructors create a fun environment where young people are encouraged to collaborate, experiment, and discover the joy of writing music. 


After school:
We offer after-school workshops for the young producers who are serious about their production. Those who participate in the after-school workshops are often already involved with YPG through in-school workshops or private lessons. Those who are new to YPG typically are already producing on their own. If not, they know that production will be something they will take seriously. With two different levels, young people can be at any skill level in the after-school workshops as long as they are passionate about electronic music. DJs, producers, managers, and other people working in the music industry come in and share their knowledge and passion with the group. Previous guests artists include Daedelus, Groundislava, John Tejada, DJ House Shoes, Benedek, and many others.

Private Lessons:
Private lessons give YPG members an opportunity to dig deep into the topics they find most interesting and refine their work one-on-one with a YPG instructor. The member's interests guide the instruction. If a member would like to have a lesson with Lawrence Grey, they will need to travel to his studio in Koreatown. The other YPG instructors can travel to a memberâ€™s house. Lessons are one or two hours long.
