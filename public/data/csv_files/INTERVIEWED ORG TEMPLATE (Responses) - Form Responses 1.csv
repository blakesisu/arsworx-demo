Every day, our teaching artists transform lives and communities through the power of art. They teach year-round studio art classes for all ages at our Old Pasadena facility. They collaborate with incarcerated teens to create murals inside juvenile detention camps. They instruct graphic design workshops at continuation high schools in Boyle Heights. They help public school teachers integrate art with math to excite imaginations and inspire critical thinking. They deliver free art classes at low-income elementary schools, inner-city parks, and recreation centers—mentoring some our most vulnerable community members. 

Community Arts Program:
The Armory’s mission is to build on the power of art to transform lives and communities through creating, teaching and presenting the arts. In the community the Armory has provided a wide range of programming for students of all ages since 1983. Classes are taught by professionally trained teaching artists committed to creating safe, supportive environments in which students can have fun learning experiences about contemporary art, while developing their artistic skills and exploring stimulating ideas.

Armory Schools Program:
The Armory is committed to delivering innovative, sequential and standards-based visual art programs to K-12 schools. We place professional teaching artists directly into schools through customized residencies. These programs may happen during the school day in selected classrooms or throughout a school. Our School Programs link visual arts with other curricular areas such as language arts, math, and sciences in ways that are authentic, multilayered and complex. The interdisciplinary focus promotes learning by providing students with opportunities to solve problems, and with meaningful connections within the arts and across the curriculum.

Art High:
Since 2006, the Armory’s Art High programs have made free after school art classes and mentorship opportunities readily accessible to local teens at parks, schools, and community centers throughout the region.

In order to best reflect the communities we serve, we believe we need to actively help build a workforce of people with a diverse set of life experiences and ideas. In this way, we can innovate, inspire and engage with the widest possible audience. Through the DAP, we provide opportunities to apprentices from groups underrepresented on museum staffs.

The DAP has two main goals. First, to train 16 apprentices in two groups. The first group of eight apprentices will begin in 2018. A second group of eight apprentices will begin in 2019. Apprentices will gain valuable skill-sets through hands-on learning. They will put their skills to work at several partner sites. Our second goal is to drive long-lasting, industrywide change.

The Visual and Performing Arts are an integral part of the District's comprehensive curriculum and are essential for learning in the 21st century.  All LAUSD students, from every culture and socioeconomic level, deserve quality arts learning in dance, music, theatre, visual and media arts as part of the core curriculum. The Arts Equity Index (AEI) assists in making sure all students gain this access. The AEI categorizes all LAUSD schools (K-12) based on the scope of their provided arts instruction, arts resources, arts professional development, Title 1 Status, and Student Equity Index (Poverty, Foster Students, English Language Learners). Based on their category, grossly underserved to strong, assessments are taken to provide more equity of arts resources, and to ensure that all students have appropriate arts access and instruction.

Arts Community Network: Through our Arts Community Network, LAUSD supports organizations that enhance our students' arts education experience.  When we send professional teaching artists directly into the classroom, it transforms the learning environment.  When students visit a museum, theater, concert hall, or cultural institution, they deepen their understanding of our city and our world. 

Creative Industry Coalition (CIC): The Creative Industry Coalition aims to harness the resources of studios, unions and production companies in the district's backyard, and bring them to students through equipment donations, classroom visits, field trips and more. Over the years, the Arts Education Branch has met with L.A.'s creative industry to discuss ways to better prepare students for their creative futures. CIC partners sponsor citywide arts festivals, provide hands-on workshops, host field trips where students are able to tour facilities, facilitate the opportunity to meet professional artists, and learn about career pathways. 

LINKED LEARNING: 
The LAUSD Linked Learning initiative is transforming high school into a personally relevant and engaging experience by bringing together strong academics, demanding career technical education, real-world experience, and integrated student support systems to help students gain an advantage in high school, in post secondary education, and in their future careers. 

Participation in Linked Learning prepares students to graduate from high school and to succeed in a full range of options after graduation, including two- or four-year colleges, certification programs, apprenticeships, or formal job training. Students follow career-themed Pathways, choosing among fields such as engineering and architecture, arts, media and entertainment, or health science and medical technology.
 
In 2017-18, LAUSD was home to 44 Linked Learning pathways. Fourteen of those pathways linked students to opportunities in the arts, media and entertainment field. Examples of Linked Learning pathways include: Los Angeles High School of the Arts (LAHSA) at RFK Community Schools; Critical Design & Gaming School (C:\DAGS) at Hawkins High School; School of Global and Media Arts (SGMA) at Fremont High School; Art Language Performance Humanities Academy (ALPHA) at Bell High School.","5-10, 11-13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18",No restrictions/all populations served,more than 1000,City of Los Angeles,"333 South Beaudry Avenue

Through PIPELINES mobile app we connect underrepresented talent, high school and college students to opportunities, using customizable filters and geo-location technologies, to find the right opportunities. Users (talent and students) only see potential opportunities that are relevant to their interests, filters and criteria. Company participants will be able to do the same. When a company participant and user both flag or “like” each other, this is considered a match and enables messaging right through the app. Students will be able to experience scholarships, mentorships, summer or after school employment, internships, and job shadowing.

Through its Tony Bennett Arts Education Program, Exploring the Arts (ETA) makes a four-year commitment to its Partner Schools, helping them build sequential, school-day arts programs and increase out-of-school opportunities in the arts for their students. ETA partners with public high schools, a majority holding Title I designation.

Through its core, capacity-building initiative, ETA provides strategic planning, funding, and assessment support over the course of four years to help principals and teachers build rigorous, school-day arts programs and curricula that lead to measurable improvements in student learning, student engagement, and program sustainability. ETA's coaches work with schools to help them identify and achieve specific goals for developing their arts programs and to equip them with the tools for more effective program administration.

Art Internship Program for Students:
Rooted in a Positive Youth Development framework, ETA's Arts Internship Program places 11th and 12th graders from ETA Partner Schools as paid interns in mentorship with professionals working in the arts. Students receive arts training, participate on arts management projects, attend shows, and practice setting and achieving realistic goals with the support of caring, trusted adults.

The student population ETA serves in Los Angeles lacks equal access to two key experiences traditionally enjoyed by their peers in more advantaged socio-economic groups: workplace internships and engagement with their city's arts sector. As a result, they are often under-prepared for postsecondary success, uninformed of their options, and alienated from the creative industries that serve as essential economic engines to their city. ETA's program was designed to address this disparity. Through participation, students deepen their arts learning, hone transferrable skills applicable to college and career, begin to build their professional networks, and identify potential careers that include viable pathways in the arts. Most important, they gain a stronger sense of direction, self-knowledge, and possibility for their futures.","14, 15, 16, 17, 18",Low-income students,501-1000,"Eastside (Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Lincoln Heights), Pasadena, South Los Angeles (Watts, Jefferson Park, Hyde Park, Historic South-Central, Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw)","202 West 1st Street, Suite 6-0410

Thanks to thousands of volunteer mentors, actors, and professional teaching artists, we serve more than 60 public schools in Los Angeles and New York City, reaching 1,200 students in elementary, middle, and high school each year. Our mission is to inspire young people to discover the power of their own voice.

Script-to-Stage:
The Script-to-Stage program meets once a week for ten weeks, typically for an hour during unstructured school lunch time. Led by a volunteer Head Mentor, each session is a mixture of creative game play and one-on-one writing time. Students are paired with a mentor from the entertainment industry to help guide and encourage them as they imagine and develop their own short script. At the end of the program, professional actors volunteer to perform the students’ scripts at an in-school assembly called the “Big Show.”

Movie Makers:
Over two semesters, Movie Makers guides students through the process of creating their own short film. Professional Teaching Artists work with high school mentors (from our P.O.V. program) to help students develop ideas using group activities and hands-on experience. Professional actors are recruited to perform in the films while Movie Makers students act as directors and cinematographers. The program culminates in both a screening for family and friends and the creation of a trailer for the film that the students use to pitch their project to industry producers.

P.O.V.:
Students in the P.O.V. program explore their unique point of view using personal stories, themes, and questions important to them. Using this material as inspiration for their writing process, students develop a film project. P.O.V. guides students through crafting a logline and treatment in the style and genre they choose, writing and directing a short film, editing their film, and pitching their film to industry professionals. P.O.V. participants receive industry-focused Master Classes, may attend the NY Film Academy Summer Camp at Universal Studios (at no cost), and may be hired as paid summer program teaching artists and documentarians for Young Storytellers. The year-long program culminates in a screening of student produced films for family and peers.

As college students, P.O.V. alumni are eligible for professional internships within the entertainment industry through our Hollywood corporate partners.","11-13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18","Low-income students, No restrictions/all populations served",more than 1000,"Burbank, Central Los Angeles (Hollywood, Mid-City, Mid-Wilshire, Downtown, Koreatown, Pico-Union), Compton, Culver City, Eastside (Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Lincoln Heights), San Fernando Valley (Canoga Park, Northridge, Reseda, Pacoima, Van Nuys), South Los Angeles (Watts, Jefferson Park, Hyde Park, Historic South-Central, Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw), Westside (Mar Vista, Venice, Westwood, Palms, Brentwood), County of Los Angeles, Santa Monica","923 East 3rd Street, #307
