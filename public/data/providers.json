    "overview": "At the core of our mission is a deep commitment to social justice through arts education. Every day, our teaching artists transform lives and communities through the power of art. They teach year-round studio art classes for all ages at our Old Pasadena facility. They collaborate with incarcerated teens to create murals inside juvenile detention camps. They instruct graphic design workshops at continuation high schools in Boyle Heights. They help public school teachers integrate art with math to excite imaginations and inspire critical thinking. They deliver free art classes at low-income elementary schools, inner-city parks, and recreation centers���mentoring some our most vulnerable community members. \n\nCommunity Arts Program:\nThe Armory�۪s mission is to build on the power of art to transform lives and communities through creating, teaching and presenting the arts. In the community the Armory has provided a wide range of programming for students of all ages since 1983. Classes are taught by professionally trained teaching artists committed to creating safe, supportive environments in which students can have fun learning experiences about contemporary art, while developing their artistic skills and exploring stimulating ideas.\n\nArmory Schools Program:\nThe Armory is committed to delivering innovative, sequential and standards-based visual art programs to K-12 schools. We place professional teaching artists directly into schools through customized residencies. These programs may happen during the school day in selected classrooms or throughout a school. Our School Programs link visual arts with other curricular areas such as language arts, math, and sciences in ways that are authentic, multilayered and complex. The interdisciplinary focus promotes learning by providing students with opportunities to solve problems, and with meaningful connections within the arts and across the curriculum.\n\nArt High:\nSince 2006, the Armory�۪s Art High programs have made free after school art classes and mentorship opportunities readily accessible to local teens at parks, schools, and community centers throughout the region.",
